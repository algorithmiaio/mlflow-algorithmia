Deploy MLflow models to Algorithmia

## Install

```
pip install mlflow-algorithmia
```

## Usage

This is based on the [mlflow tutorial](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/tutorials-and-examples/tutorial.html)
we reproduce some steps here but for more details please see the official [mlflow docs](https://www.mlflow.org/docs).

Create a model by running this script:

```
python examples/sklearn_elasticnet_wine/train.py
```

This will create an `mlruns` directory that contains the trained model,
you can run the mlflow UI running `mlflow ui` or serve the model locally using the
mlflow server running:

```
$ mlflow models serve -m mlruns/0/<run-id>/artifacts/model -p 1234
```

And make a test query

```
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json; format=pandas-split" --data '{"columns":["alcohol", "chlorides", "citric acid", "density", "fixed acidity", "free sulfur dioxide", "pH", "residual sugar", "sulphates", "total sulfur dioxide", "volatile acidity"],"data":[[12.8, 0.029, 0.48, 0.98, 6.2, 29, 3.33, 1.2, 0.39, 75, 0.66]]}' http://127.0.0.1:1234/invocations

[5.120775719594933]
```

Now let's deploy the same model in Algorithmia, you will need:

1. An Algorithmia API key with `Read + Write` data access
2. The path to the model (under `mlruns`) you want to deploy, for example: `mlruns/0/<run-id>/artifacts/model`

Set your Algorithmia API key and username as environment variables:

```
export ALGORITHMIA_USERNAME=<username>
export ALGORITHMIA_API_KEY=<api-key>
```

Create the deployment:

```
mlflow deployments create -t algorithmia --name mlflow_sklearn_demo -m mlruns/0/<run-id>/artifacts/model
```

```

```

Save the new model version from the output to query the model.

### Query the model in Algorithmia

You need the new model version from above and the `ALGORITHMIA_USERNAME` and `ALGORITHMIA_API_KEY` variables you used before.

Replace `<version>` with the model version from the previous command output.

```
curl -X POST -d '{"columns":["alcohol", "chlorides", "citric acid", "density", "fixed acidity", "free sulfur dioxide", "pH", "residual sugar", "sulphates", "total sulfur dioxide", "volatile acidity"],"data":[[12.8, 0.029, 0.48, 0.98, 6.2, 29, 3.33, 1.2, 0.39, 75, 0.66]]}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Simple '${ALGORITHMIA_API_KEY} https://api.algorithmia.com/v1/algo/$ALGORITHMIA_USERNAME/mlflow_sklearn_demo/<version>
```

You can also use `mlflow deployments predict` command to query the model, on this case it will always query the **latest public published** version of the model, to query a specific version use the method described above.

First create a `predict_input.json` file:

```
echo '{"alcohol":{"0":12.8},"chlorides":{"0":0.029},"citric acid":{"0":0.48},"density":{"0":0.98},"fixed acidity":{"0":6.2},"free sulfur dioxide":{"0":29},"pH":{"0":3.33},"residual sugar":{"0":1.2},"sulphates":{"0":0.39},"total sulfur dioxide":{"0":75},"volatile acidity":{"0":0.66}}' > predict_input.json
```

Now query the latest public published version of the model:

```
mlflow deployments predict -t algorithmia --name mlflow_sklearn_demo -I predict_input.json
```

To update deployment, for example after training a new model:

```
mlflow deployments update -t algorithmia --name mlflow_sklearn_demo -m <path-to-new-model-dir>
```

To delete the deployment:

```
mlflow deployments delete -t algorithmia --name mlflow_sklearn_demo
```
